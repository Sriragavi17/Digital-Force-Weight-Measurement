# Digital Force and Weight Measurement System

## Overview
This project focuses on the design and implementation of a digital force and weight measurement system using a load cell sensor. The system converts applied force into an electrical signal and displays the corresponding weight digitally.

## Components Used
- Load Cell
- Signal Conditioning Circuit (Instrumentation Amplifier)
- ADC Module
- Microcontroller
- Display Unit

## Working Principle
The load cell produces a small analog voltage proportional to the applied force. This signal is amplified using a signal conditioning circuit and converted into digital form using an ADC. The processed digital data is used to calculate and display the weight.

## Design & Implementation
- Designed the signal conditioning circuit to amplify low-level sensor signals.
- Interfaced the load cell with ADC and microcontroller.
- Implemented calibration to improve measurement accuracy.
- Displayed measured weight in digital format.

## Results
The system accurately measures force and weight with good stability and repeatability after calibration.

## Applications
- Digital weighing scales
- Industrial force measurement
- Embedded measurement systems
